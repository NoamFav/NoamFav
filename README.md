## 🏋🏻‍♂️ Passion for the Gym

I’m really passionate about the gym—it’s my way to unwind and stay focused. Lifting weights and working out six days a week keeps me sharp, both mentally and physically. It’s not just about the numbers, but about the discipline and consistency that come with it. Whether I’m aiming for a new personal best or just enjoying the process, the gym is a huge part of my routine. It’s the perfect balance to all the time I spend in front of a screen coding and building projects.
